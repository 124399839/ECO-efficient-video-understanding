By Mohammadreza Zolfaghari, Kamaljeet Singh, Thomas Brox


### Update
- **2018.4.17**: Repository for ECO.


### Introduction
This repository will contains all the required models and scripts for the paper [ECO: Efficient Convolutional Network for Online Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.09066.pdf).

In this work, we introduce a network architecture that takes long-term content into account and enables fast per-video processing at the same time. The architecture is based on merging long-term content already in the network rather than in a post-hoc fusion. Together with a sampling strategy, which exploits that neighboring frames are largely redundant, this yields high-quality action classification and video captioning at up to 230 videos per second, where each video can consist of a few hundred frames. The approach achieves competitive performance across all datasets while being 10x to 80x faster than state-of-the-art methods.
